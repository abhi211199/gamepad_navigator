# gamepad_navigator
## Let's navigate the web with a `gaming controller - keyboard and mouse`

This is a prototype built using Python. Currently, the key mappings are:
- AXIS 0 and AXIS 1 Movement of mouse pointer
- AXIS 2 and AXIS 3: Scroll Bar Actions
- Home button: Opens a new Chrome Tab
- Start Button: Text to Speech
- B4 and B5: Left and Right Click respectively
- B6 and B7: Swiping of Chrome Tabs

## Setting up the Platform and running the App:
- `pip3 install pygame pyautogui webbrowser speech_recognition playsound`
- `python3 game.py`
